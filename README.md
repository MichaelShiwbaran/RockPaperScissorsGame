# RockPaperScissorsGame

This project is a website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where users can go to learn about the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. There is filler information about two people who want to teach users how to play, and there is an actual Rock, Paper, Scissors game that the user can play against the computer with predetermined outcomes, such as rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
